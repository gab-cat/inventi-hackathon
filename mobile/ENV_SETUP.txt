ENVIRONMENT SETUP REQUIRED:

To fix the "Network request failed" error when uploading photos, you need to create a .env file in the mobile directory with the following variables:

# Convex Configuration
EXPO_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=your-convex-url-here

# Clerk Configuration
EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-clerk-publishable-key-here

You can find your Convex URL in your Convex dashboard or by running:
npx convex dev --once

And your Clerk publishable key in your Clerk dashboard.
